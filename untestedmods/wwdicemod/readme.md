#White Wolf Dice Roller

A mod that adds commands for rolling dice for white wolf games. Uses the random.org php client to get random numbers (http://www.random.org/clients/php-client)

Syntax for commands:

!command <number of dice> <reason (optional)>

Commands:
!roll 10s reroll
!9roll 9s & 10s reroll
!8roll 8s, 9s, & 10s reroll
!sroll No rerolls, 1s subtract
!chance Chance die
!init roll initiative
!inits ditto

!chance, !init, & !init don't require a number of dice (since the number's always 1)
