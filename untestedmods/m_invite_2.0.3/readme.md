This has been updated. Before adding the channel to the maintain list,
it removes it from the maintain list (does nothing if its not already there).
Additionally, you have the option to edit the .php file and give nicknames of
those whom you would like notified when someone invites the bot. Also, the bot
tells the inviting person that their attempt has been logged. (it is not really logged)
After this it joins the channel (if too many arent already joined)
