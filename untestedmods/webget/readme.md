#Web Get

This is a work in progress.

This program is invoked in the admin chat with "wget url", where url is either an http or ftp address. The file(s) is then downloaded to a directory specified by the user.

Currently only FTP PASV downloading is supported, and it has been tested very little.

Future plans are to include HTTP support and beta test it more.
