#Spotify Lookup

Whenever someone links a spotify track this module looks up the song's name and artist and outputs that to the channel.

Track support only. makes no checks for albums artists or other spotify links.
The trigger is on "spotify:track:"

It's very basic. Doesn't check for error, valid links or nothing. But it works as intended.
